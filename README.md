This is my first app built using Angular4.  It is a simple photogallery app that allows users to filter the gallery view by category.  Images are clickable and will link to the full size image on click.

# Gallery

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
